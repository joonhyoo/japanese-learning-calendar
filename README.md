# Simple calendar for my Japanese Learning

This is a simple backendless react page which holds a github actions-coded calendar which will replace / improve upon what I do physically on paper.

At the moment, I write down on a piece of paper what I've done for the day so I can remember - but I think a digital version that I can look at online will be more epic >:&#41;

## ðŸ“Œ User Stories

- [ ] As a user, I want to mark my flashcard sessions (WaniKani, Bunpro, reviews) as completed for today and the previous day so I can track my study progress.
- [ ] As a user, I want to click on a calendar day to view the flashcard sessions I completed on that date so I can review my past study history.
